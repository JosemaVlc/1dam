                    <address>Roberto Pérez</address>
                    <p><span>Lorem Ipsum</span> is simply dummy text of the printi
                    ng and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum
                    has been the
                    industry's
                    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                    printer took a galley of type and
                    scrambled it to
                    make
                    a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centur
                    ies, but also the leap into electronic
                    typesetting,
                    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
                    1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
                    containing <a href=""><span>Lorem Ipsum</span></a>
                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publi
                    shing software like Aldus PageMaker
                    including
                    versions
                    of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply rando
                    m text. It has roots in a piece of
                    classical Latin
                    literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Rich
                    ard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                    <span>HampdenSydney College</span> in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin wor
                    ds,
                    consectetur, from a Lorem
                    Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in
                    classical literature, discovered the
                    undoubtable
                    source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.3
                    3 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The
                    Extremes
                    of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book i
                    s a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
                    popular
                    during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lo
                    rem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a
                    line in
                    section 1.10.32.
