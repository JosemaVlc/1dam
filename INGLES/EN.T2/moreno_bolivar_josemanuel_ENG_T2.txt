Hello,

Thank you for helping me to be healthier.

My name is Jose Manuel, I live in Valencia (Spain) and I shop at your store sporadically.

Last month I bought one of your sports watches(count steps). I didn't know if it would be 
useful to me. After a month of use, I am so amazed that I want to thank you.

My new watch is sensational, the battery charge lasts a long time, the materials are 
excellent and it has interchangeable straps. All of this has motivated to walk every day 
more.

The use I give it is not sporty, so I would like to make the following suggestion. 
Currently, the device has interchangeable straps, but they are all rubber, so using it in 
serious events is impossible for me. They could create and distribute leather straps or 
other materials to be used on occasions where seriousness is required.

All the best.

Jose Manuel Moreno Bolivar.
